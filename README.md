# Building_a_deep_CNN_-ResNet-
In this project I'll be build a very deep convolutional network, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by He et al., allows to train much deeper networks than were previously feasible.
